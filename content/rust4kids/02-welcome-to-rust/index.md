# Welcome to Rust

Now that you know how computers work and how they think, it's time to start programming! In this section, you'll meet **Rust**, a fast, fun, and powerful language used by real engineers all over the world. And now, by you! 🎉

We'll guide you through installing Rust, writing your first “Hello, world!” program, and learning the most important building blocks: **variables**, **data types**, **functions**, and **loops**. Along the way, you'll discover how to make decisions in code, repeat actions, and add helpful comments that make your programs easier to understand. Step by step, you'll become a real **Rustacean**, someone who speaks computer with claws! 🦀💻

Let's dive in!
