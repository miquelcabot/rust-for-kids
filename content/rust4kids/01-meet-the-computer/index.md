# Meet the Computer

Before we start coding in Rust, let's take a little tour of the magical machine we'll be working with: 🧠 **the computer**!

In this chapter, you'll learn:

- 🧱 **What a computer is made of**. Including its brain (CPU), memory (RAM), and how it stores stuff (storage).
- 🗂️ **How computers organize information** using files and folders.
- 💻 **How to use the terminal**. A secret door where you type commands and talk to your computer like a real programmer.
- 🔢 **How computers think in binary**. Just 1s and 0s, like tiny light switches turning on and off.

By the end of this section, you'll have x-ray vision for how your device works and be ready to write your very first lines of code. Let's peek inside the machine! 👀⚙️
