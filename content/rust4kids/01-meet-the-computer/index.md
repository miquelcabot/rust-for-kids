# Meet the Computer

Before we learn how to program in Rust, let’s take a moment to understand the magical machine we’re going to talk to: the computer! In this section, we’ll explore how computers are built (hardware) and how they follow instructions (software). Then, we’ll learn how to navigate files and folders using a secret passage called the terminal. Finally, we’ll uncover the language that computers truly understand: binary — a world made entirely of 1s and 0s. Get ready to look inside the computer’s brain and start thinking like a real programmer!
