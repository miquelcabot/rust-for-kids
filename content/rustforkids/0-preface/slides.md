## 👋 Welcome to *Rust for Kids*

Have you ever wondered how video games, robots, or websites are built? Or how your computer understands what to do when you click a button or type a word?

In this book, you'll start from the very beginning: learning how computers store files, follow instructions, and even speak in binary! Then we'll dive into **Rust**, a fun, powerful programming language that's used in everything from spaceships to video games.

This book is designed especially for **kids, teens, parents, and curious beginners**. No experience needed. Just bring your imagination and a little curiosity. 🧠✨

## 🦀 Why Rust?

Rust is different from many other programming languages. Here's why we love it:

- ✅ **Fast and efficient**: used in real-world systems like Firefox and Linux.
- 🧠 **Safe by design**: it helps prevent bugs before they happen!
- ❤️ **Friendly**: it has a great community and excellent documentation.
- 🧰 **Modern tooling**: with tools like `cargo`, building projects is easy and fun.
- 🌍 **Versatile**: you can build websites, games, robots, or even blockchains.

Plus... it has a super cute mascot: **Ferris the Crab**! 🦀
