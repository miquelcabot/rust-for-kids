**Rust for Kids** is an educational project designed to introduce the Rust programming language to young learners in a fun, accessible, and interactive way. Using a combination of [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) and [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/), this book blends storytelling, visual slides, and hands-on coding examples to teach core programming concepts through Rust. Whether you're a teacher, parent, or curious kid, this resource aims to make systems programming approachable and enjoyable. One small Rustacean step at a time!

## Read the Book

We suggest the [online](#hosted-online) version for general use, but cloning, installing, and building this book [offline](#build-offline) is a great option on-the-go.

### Hosted Online

The latest version is hosted at: [https://rust-for-kids.cabot.dev](https://rust-for-kids.cabot.dev)

### Build Offline

You need to [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) before you can continue.

In order to `make` your life easy ðŸ˜‰, there is a set of tasks that use [`cargo make`](https://sagiegurari.github.io/cargo-make/#overview).

With [`cargo make`](https://sagiegurari.github.io/cargo-make/#installation) installed, you can list all tasks included to facilitate further installation, building, serving, formatting, and more with:

```sh
# Run from the top-level working dir of this repo
makers --list-all-steps
```

The tasks should be self-explanatory, if they are not - please file an issue to help us make them better.
